/* Winios.m — iOS user_driver implementation for Wine.
 *
 * The Wine win32u-unix side declares weak externs `winios_pCreateWindow`,
 * `winios_pProcessEvents`, etc. in build/win32u-unix/driver_ios.c. This
 * file implements them and gets linked into Madeira.app, completing the
 * driver-funcs slots. Slots we don't implement here (e.g. WintabProc,
 * Vulkan) stay weak-resolved-to-NULL and __wine_set_user_driver falls
 * back to win32u's always-success nulldrv_* stubs.
 *
 * Architecture goal: every UIKit-side state lives here, on the Madeira
 * app side; the driver-facing surface is plain C functions taking Wine
 * types (HWND, HCURSOR, etc.) so the win32u side stays portable.
 *
 * Current status: SCAFFOLD. Functions return success/identity values
 * suitable for "first frames render" — full UIKit window/event bridging
 * lands incrementally. Real games will need pProcessEvents to actually
 * drain UIKit events into Wine's queue.

 * freeze detector (ml519)
 * ============================================================
 *
 * Every run suffers a long whole-app freeze — measured at 96.0s starting
 * t+8.5s in ml515 — that ends with StikDebug detaching (after which no NEW
 * exec mappings are possible). It is NOT a deadlock in our code: #67's
 * in-process "accuser" sampler could not run during it either, which means
 * the whole Mach TASK is suspended from outside. It happens in Thumper as
 * well as Steam, so it is a property of the port, not of any title.
 *
 * Nothing inside the process can observe a suspension WHILE it happens.
 * But it can be measured RETROSPECTIVELY: sleep a short fixed interval and
 * compare against a clock that keeps counting while we are stopped.
 * mach_absolute_time() does exactly that. gettimeofday() is logged beside
 * it so a device sleep (both jump) is distinguishable from a task
 * suspension (both jump, but the app was foreground) and from a clock
 * glitch (only one jumps).
 *
 * The HEARTBEAT is not decoration. The srcwatch probe wasted two runs
 * because "armed but zero firings" was read as a clean result when it
 * actually meant the probe was dead. Here, silence is ambiguous the same
 * way — no GAP lines could mean no freeze, or a detector that never
 * started. The heartbeat removes that ambiguity: if heartbeats are present
 * and GAPs are absent, the run genuinely did not freeze.
 *
 * Context is logged with each gap so freezes can be correlated ACROSS
 * TITLES: thread count and resident size are the two things that differ
 * most between Thumper (few threads) and Steam (100+), which is exactly
 * the comparison that would show whether cost scales with thread count.

/* ml661 — THE RING IS DRAINED AT THE GAME'S FRAME RATE, NOT AT TOUCH RATE.
 *
 * The only consumer is winios_pProcessEvents, which runs inside the game's own
 * message pump (message_ios.c process_driver_events, reached from PeekMessage
 * and from GetAsyncKeyState's check_for_events). A game rendering at 15 fps
 * drains ~15×/s; while it streams a level it can be a *tenth* of that, so the
 * ring goes untouched for seconds at a time.
 *
 * The producer does not slow down to match. The aim stick is a CADisplayLink:
 * it posts one relative MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE per display frame, 60–120/s, for as
 * long as a thumb rests on it. So in a single 5-second stall the stick alone
 * offers ~600 events into a 256-slot ring.
 *
 * The old policy was DROP-NEWEST ("if (next != tail)" and otherwise silently
 * do nothing — the comment even claimed it dropped the oldest, which it never
 * did). Once the stick had filled the ring, every subsequent event was thrown
 * away, and the events being thrown away were the ones that matter: the key
 * DOWN from the movement stick, the key UP that stops walking, the LEFTDOWN
 * from a landscape button. That is the reported failure exactly — sticks and
 * buttons go dead mid-fight, and come back when the frame rate recovers and
 * the backlog finally drains. A half-dropped pair is worse still: a surviving
 * DOWN whose UP was dropped leaves the key stuck on inside the game.
 *
 * Fix, in two parts:
 *   1. Motion is COALESCED, not queued. Consecutive pure moves merge — relative
 *      deltas sum, absolute positions keep the newest. That is lossless for the
 *      game (a mouse that moved 300 counts over 5s is indistinguishable from
 *      one 300-count report at the moment of the read) and it means the stick
 *      can no longer fill anything: a whole stall collapses into one event.
 *   2. Transitions are NEVER dropped. A key down/up or a button down/up always
 *      gets a slot; if the ring is somehow still full, room is made by dropping
 *      the oldest *move*, which is the only event class that can be lost
 *      without the game ending up in a wrong state.
 *
 * A "pure move" is the only mergeable/droppable class: MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE with
 * (optionally) ABSOLUTE and nothing else. Note post_touch_down deliberately
 * posts MOVE|LEFTDOWN|ABSOLUTE as one event — the button bit makes it a
 * transition, so it is never touched by either mechanism.

 * surface is the app's own window-level CAMetalLayer (MetalHostView, added
 * directly to the UIWindow above the entire SwiftUI tree — see
 * ContentView.swift's file-top comment), so in that mode the cursor is

 * once, right after registering the same layer with DXMT
 * (MetalBackedView.didMoveToWindow) — see winios_set_game_layer, and
 * Winios.h's doc comment for why this takes `void *` and not `CAMetalLayer
 * *`.
 *
 * Positioning then needs only two numbers this file can get on its own:
 * the layer's own `bounds` (which IS the current game rect in POINTS —
 * MetalHostView.shared.frame is set to exactly GameSurfaceLayout.rect()
 * converted to window coordinates on every apply, so the layer's LOCAL
 * bounds are that rect's SIZE at local origin (0,0), independent of where
 * the rect sits in the window) and the guest's logical resolution
 * (winios_screen_size(), the same live source ContentView.swift's own
 * touch-mapping and display code reads — see its guestSize()/mapTouch()).
 * A drawable presented into a CAMetalLayer fills its bounds exactly
 * (default contentsGravity is resize/stretch, and gameRect() already chose
 * this rect to HAVE the guest's own aspect for every DisplayMode except
 * Stretch, where stretching is the guest's own mapping too) — so
 * guest-pixel -> layer-point is one uniform scale that is correct for
