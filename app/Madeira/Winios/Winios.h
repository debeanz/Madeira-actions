/* Winios.h — registration entry point for the iOS user_driver.
 *
 * winios.drv is Madeira's iOS-side replacement for Wine's per-platform
 * display drivers (winemac.drv, winex11.drv, etc.). It plugs into the
 * win32u-unix `__wine_set_user_driver` extension point, providing the
 * minimum-viable pieces of the user_driver_funcs interface that real
 * games need: window lifecycle (CreateWindow → UIView/CAMetalLayer),
 * event pump (PeekMessage → drained UIKit events), display device
 * description, and touch→mouse input.
 *
 * Most slots in the driver struct are intentionally left NULL.
 * __wine_set_user_driver's SET_USER_FUNC fallback fills missing slots
 * with the always-success nulldrv_* stubs in win32u/driver.c, which is
 * fine for everything DXMT-rendered games need (they own the actual
 * graphics surface via CAMetalLayer; we just bridge windowing/input).
 *
 * Lifecycle: load_display_driver() in build/win32u-unix/driver_ios.c
 * calls winios_drv_register() at first user_driver lazy-load, replacing
 * the current null_user_driver registration on iOS.

 * ml668 — THE GAMEPAD SLOT.
 *
 * A gamepad is not an event stream, it is a STATE, and that is the whole
 * reason it does not go through the coalescing ring above. Every other input
 * this file carries is a TRANSITION that Windows must not lose (a key down
 * whose up was dropped leaves the key stuck); XInput is the opposite — a game
 * calls XInputGetState 60 to 1000 times a second and wants the CURRENT
 * deflection of both sticks, and the only thing it can do with a queue of
 * stale samples is throw them away. So the pad is a plain shared struct that
 * the app overwrites and wine reads, with no queue, no lock and no wakeup.
 *
 * WHY A SEQLOCK AND NOT A MUTEX. The reader is a guest thread in the middle
 * of a game's input poll, possibly inside a frame's critical path, and it
 * shares one Mach task with the writer (`WOW64_DESIGN.md` §2 — every Windows
 * process here is a thread in this task, so this really is a plain memory
 * read, no server round trip and no IPC). A mutex there would let a UI-thread
 * write preempted mid-update block a 1000 Hz poll. The seqlock costs the
 * reader two atomic loads and a 16-byte copy in the uncontended case, cannot
 * block, and cannot hand out a torn sample: an odd counter, or a counter that
 * moved across the copy, means "the writer was inside — read it again".
 *
 * PACKET NUMBERS are what a game uses to tell "nothing changed" from "I am
 * polling faster than the pad reports", so the writer bumps `packet` ONLY when
 * some field actually differs. A packet number that ticks on every sample is
 * indistinguishable from noise and defeats the optimisation it exists for.
 * ======================================================================== */

 * is included from Swift, and the translation to XINPUT_STATE happens once, in
 * build/win32u-unix/driver_ios.c, where the Windows headers exist.
 *
 * The DEAD ZONE IS NOT APPLIED HERE. XInput's convention is that the
 * application owns it (XINPUT_GAMEPAD_LEFT_THUMB_DEADZONE is a constant a game
 * may ignore or replace), and a driver that pre-clamps makes a game's own
